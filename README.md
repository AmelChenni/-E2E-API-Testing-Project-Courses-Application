# 🛡️ E2E API Testing Project: Courses Application

🌐 **Project Documentation:** [Postman E2E Testing Project](https://github.com/AmelChenni/-E2E-API-Testing-Project-Courses-Application/tree/main)  

---

## 📖 Description
This repository demonstrates the practical application of **End-to-End (E2E) API testing** using **Postman**, **Newman**, and **Jenkins**, learned during a complete Postman course.

The project tests a **Courses API** with **CRUD operations** (`login`, `post a course`, `get course`, `update course`, `delete course`) and covers **functional, negative, and response validation testing**, along with automated execution and CI/CD.

### Key Project Deliverables
- **Comprehensive API Test Collection**: Covers all endpoints with assertions on status codes, response times, and payloads.  
- **Automated Test Execution**: Implemented with **Newman CLI** and **HTML reports** using `htmlextra`.  
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Configured **Jenkins** to run E2E tests automatically, including scheduled runs.  
- **Test Documentation**: Organized **Excel sheets** for Test Cases and Bug Reports.  

---

## 🚀 Key QA Skills & Features
- **🔬 API Functional & Negative Testing**: Validated all endpoints and tested invalid inputs.  
- **📝 Assertions & Response Validation**: Status codes, response times, JSON structure validation.  
- **📊 Reporting & Documentation**: Generated **HTML reports** and tracked results in **Excel/Sheets**.  
- **🔄 CI/CD Implementation**: Automated test execution in Jenkins every minute or on demand.  
- **📌 Environment & Global Variables**: Managed environments in Postman for local and mock servers.  
- **🛡️ Basic Security Checks**: Authentication tests and secured paths tested.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Postman** — API testing and collection management  
- **Newman & Newman htmlextra** — CLI automation and HTML reporting  
- **Jenkins** — CI/CD setup for automated test runs  
- **Insomnia** — Optional tool for API testing and comparison  
- **Google Sheets / Excel** — Test case and bug tracking  
- **Node.js / JSON Server** — Fake server for local testing  
- **VS Code** — Development environment

## 📌 Future Scope & Improvements
- **SQL / Database Validation**: Verify backend data after API calls  
- **UI Testing**: Extend testing using **Cypress / Playwright**  
- **Advanced CI/CD**: Integrate Docker or GitHub Actions for cross-platform automation  
- **Performance Testing**: Add load/stress testing using **JMeter** or **Locust**  
- **Security Testing**: Test authentication, authorization, and common vulnerabilities more deeply
